sample:
Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4. 0->4
Disc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1. 0->1

5 * 2 = 10

0 fails
5 works

live:
Disc #1 has 13 positions; at time=0, it is at position 10.   drop when at 12
Disc #2 has 17 positions; at time=0, it is at position 15.   and when at 16 - 1
Disc #3 has 19 positions; at time=0, it is at position 17.   and when at 18 - 2
Disc #4 has 7 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.     and when at 6  - 3
Disc #5 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 0.     and when at 4  - 4
Disc #6 has 3 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.     and when at 2  - 5

notes:

it's prime numbers and factors, but with the proviso that you
need to consider the drop time. it takes one tick to traverse
a level. must pass through 0.

probably works best bottom to top.

any particular arrangement will repeat by factors

13 * 17 * 19 * 7 * 5 * 3 = 440895
