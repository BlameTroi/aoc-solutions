Day two involves assigning meaning to data and then interpretting the data in different ways.
I approached this as a chance to use control tables.

"Encrypted strategy guide"

col 1 opponent will play 
col 1 A = rock, B = paper, C = scissors

col 2 your response
col 2 X = Rock, Y = paper, Z = scissors

score is shape you selected (1 Rock, 2 Paper, 3 Scissors) plus outcome of the round (0 lose, 3 draw, 6 win).

So

A Y    paper covers rock, i win    2 + 6 = 8
B X    paper covers rock, i lose   1 + 0 = 1
C Z    we scissor, draw            3 + 3 = 6

there are 3 x 3 or 9 possible outcomes, so a table driven approach seems the most sensible.

A X    rock rock draw             1 + 3 = 4
A Y    rock paper win             2 + 6 = 8
A Z    rock scissors lose         3 + 0 = 3
B X    paper rock lose            1 + 0 = 1
B Y    paper paper draw           2 + 3 = 5
B Z    paper scissors win         3 + 6 = 9
C X    scissors rock win          1 + 6 = 7
C Y    scissors paper lose        2 + 0 = 2
C Z    scissors scissors draw     3 + 3 = 6

type tRound = record
  play: string;
  score: integer;
end;

for part 2, we learn that the second column shows how the round should end.

x = lose
y = draw
z = win

but scoring is the same

so y is easy, pick the same 

paper covers rock
rock crushes scissors
scissors cut paper

A X    rock lose scissors
A Y    rock draw rock
A Z    rock win paper
B X    paper lose rock
B Y    paper draw paper
B Z    paper win scissors
C X    scissors lose paper
C Y    scissors draw scissors
C Z    scissors win rock
