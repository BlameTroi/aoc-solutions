Here's the more complex loop again:

..F7.
.FJ|.
SJ.L7
|F--J
LJ...

Here are the distances for each tile on that loop:

..45.
.236.
01.78
14567
23...

you need the key to the symols, the entry to the maze is the S.

    | is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
    - is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
    L is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
    J is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
    7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
    F is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.
    . is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.
    S is the starting position of the animal; there is a pipe on this tile, but your sketch doesn't show what shape the pipe has.

the grid is 140x140 of these nodes
node attributes are links to the cardinal directions, an on or off the loop flag, an integer that we'll probably use for counting, but what else?

note:

each grid location has only two live connections.
many pipes in the dataset are not connected to the S pipe.
you can determine the shape of the pipe at S by what
connects to it.

from the dataset

L7.F7
7L-JL
L7S7F
7LJLJ
L----

the entry to s is from the south pipe J    w-n
the exit from s is from the east pipe 7    s-w

this means it's an F pipe, s-e.


first, let's draft up our data structures trying an array

tConnectCoord = record
  blocked: boolean;
  x, y: integer;
end;

tNode = record
  origin: boolean; the s marks the spot
  onloop: boolean; connected to origin?
  glyph : one of L7.F7-|J ... s
  path : ns, ew, ne, nw, sw, se, nil
  cahcedcoords: one for each path, can be nil.
  work : integer;
end;
    | is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
    - is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
    L is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
    J is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
    7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
    F is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.
    . is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.
unconnected pipes are in the input.

i think this is a goal seeking thing like i've did in the algorithms class, but I have to think it through some more.

useless for this run I suspect, but:
counts...
             count   minl   maxl
   lines :     140    140    140
   words :     140      1    140
per line :              1      1
   chars :   19740

character distribution...
 alphabetic :   9237
     digits :   3105
    special :   7258
white space :    140
