input is game #: sample (;sample)*
  sample is # color (, # color)*
  color is red | blue | green
  # is an integer 

part one -- sum the game #s of games for which all samples could be be
pulled from a bag of 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.

part two -- first, determine in each game you played, what is the
fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag
to make the game possible? second, determine the power of that set of
cubes. This is the number of cubes multiplied together. the answer for
part two is the sum of the powers of cubes.
