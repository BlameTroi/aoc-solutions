2023 03 gear ratios

this is a bit of a minesweeper type problem. or maybe the game of
life. given a large grid, on which possible part numbers (apparently
laid out horizontally only) must be found and summed.

the catch is that a number is a part number only if it is immediately
adjacent to a symbol. a symbol is a single character that is not a
digit or a period.

the grid is rectangular. i'll break from my tradition of linked lists
and allocate a large array of characters to store it. to make edge
checking easier there will be boundary rows and columns around the
grid.
