input here is a duration and distance and a distance to exceed. the
distance you can travel is based upon how long you delay starting.
each unit of time you wait increases your velocity by 1 unit of
distance per unit of time. if you don't wait, your velocity is 0. if
you want until the end, the effect as if you didn't do anything.

using whole numbers of units of time, how long do you need to wait to
exceed the distance given.

eg:

T=7, record distance=9

v and t are the same numerically so call it u
wait      velocity       distance (v * (t-w))
  0              0       0
  1              1       6
  2              2       10
  3              3       12
  4              4       12
  5              5       10
  6              6       6
  7              7       0

how many of the outcomes above exceed the old record?

d = u * (u - w)
  = u**2 - uw
