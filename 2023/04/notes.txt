scratchcards

given a set of used lottery scratchoff cards, score them. for part
one, the score for each card is the number of 2 ** (number of draws in
winners - 1). easy peasy. parse and count.

for part two, the number of winners gets you more copies of subsequent
cards. i fail to see how this pays off, but hey, it's a puzzle. having
more winners than cards left in the deck truncates.

the copies go in the same position as their original. things get
exponential since copies can win more copies.

count the total number of cards after a complete pass through the deck
