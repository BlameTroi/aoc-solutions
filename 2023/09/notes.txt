triangular number pattern but the basic idea looks a bit like pascal's triangle.

for each row, next row is diff
once all diffs are zero, the new value on
the right can be calculated by adding a 0 and
working the sums back up to the source row

how best to represent as a data structure?

one big matrix gets the trick done.
