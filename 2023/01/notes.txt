day one involves extracting information out of noise.

algorithmically it's very straight forward. the only catch is in part
two where the information (digits) can be spelled out in addition to
being just plain digit characters.

the question that is left unanswered in the problem text is should the
sequence zerone be interpretted as zero one or zero or one?

since the problem only concerns itself with the first and last digits
in each input line, using one seems to be the right answer. the
checksum will tell if this is so.

the only problems i had with this were self inflicted errors. i am
writing my own support functions (substr, strbegins, etc) rather than
using the library code in fpc and of course if i'm having an off day,
i make mistakes. my purpose in doing advent of code is to practice
coding as much as it is to solve problems.
